# System Patterns

## System Architecture
- The application is built using a multi-layered architecture with NextJS as the main framework.
- The user interface is developed with React combined with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI to create a modern and responsive UI.
- The project structure uses the src/app directory to manage NextJS routing and UI components.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Clearly separate UI components and business logic.
- Utilize the Chatbot API to process messages and return responses in markdown format, ensuring the scalability of the application.
- Employ IndexedDB for local data storage, optimizing the user experience in offline scenarios.
